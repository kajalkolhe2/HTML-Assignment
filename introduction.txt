HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It serves as the backbone of all web pages, providing the fundamental framework upon which websites are built. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia. These elements form the building blocks of a webpage, allowing developers to create structured documents that can be displayed in web browsers. HTML's role in web development is crucial, as it ensures that content is organized in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable, facilitating the correct rendering of web pages across different browsers and devices. Additionally, HTML allows for the integration of other technologies like CSS and JavaScript, which enhance the visual presentation and interactivity of web pages, respectively. By providing a standardized way to describe the structure and content of web documents, HTML enables developers to create accessible, consistent, and functional websites.
